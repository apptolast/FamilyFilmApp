# Mobile Testing Patterns

> **Mobile testing is NOT web testing. Different constraints, different strategies.**
> This file teaches WHEN to use each testing approach and WHY.
> **Code examples are minimal - focus on decision-making.**

## 🧠 MOBILE TESTING MINDSET

```
Mobile testing differs from web:
├── Real devices matter (emulators hide bugs)
├── Platform differences (iOS vs Android behavior)
├── Network conditions vary wildly
├── Battery/performance under test
├── App lifecycle (background, killed, restored)
├── Permissions and system dialogs
└── Touch interactions vs clicks
```

## 🚫 AI MOBILE TESTING ANTI-PATTERNS

| ❌ AI Default                | Why It's Wrong             | ✅ Mobile-Correct                 |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Jest-only testing           | Misses native layer        | Jest + E2E on device             |
| Enzyme patterns             | Deprecated, web-focused    | React Native Testing Library     |
| Browser-based E2E (Cypress) | Can't test native features | Detox / Maestro                  |
| Mock everything             | Misses integration bugs    | Real device testing              |
| Ignore platform tests       | iOS/Android differ         | Platform-specific cases          |
| Skip performance tests      | Mobile perf is critical    | Profile on low-end device        |
| Test only happy path        | Mobile has more edge cases | Offline, permissions, interrupts |
| 100% unit test coverage     | False security             | Pyramid balance                  |
| Copy web testing patterns   | Different environment      | Mobile-specific tools            |

## 2. Testing Pyramid for Mobile

```
                    ┌───────────────┐
                    │    E2E Tests  │  10%
                    │  (Real device) │  Slow, expensive, essential
                    ├───────────────┤
                    │  Integration  │  20%
                    │    Tests      │  Component + context
                    ├───────────────┤
                    │  Component    │  30%
                    │    Tests      │  Isolated UI
                    ├───────────────┤

                    └───────────────┘
```

### Why This Distribution?

| Level               | Why This %                                |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **E2E 10%**         | Slow, flaky, but catches integration bugs |
| **Integration 20%** | Tests real user flows without full app    |
| **Component 30%**   | Fast feedback on UI changes               |
| **Unit 40%**        | Fastest, most stable, logic coverage      |

> 🔴 **If you have 90% unit tests and 0% E2E, you're testing the wrong things.**

## 3. What to Test at Each Level

### Unit Tests (Jest)

```
✅ TEST:
├── Utility functions (formatDate, calculatePrice)
├── State reducers (Redux, Zustand stores)
├── API response transformers
├── Validation logic
└── Business rules

❌ DON'T TEST:
├── Component rendering (use component tests)
├── Navigation (use integration tests)
├── Native modules (mock them)
└── Third-party libraries
```

### Component Tests (RNTL / flutter_test)

```
✅ TEST:
├── Component renders correctly
├── User interactions (tap, type, swipe)
├── Loading/error/empty states
├── Accessibility labels exist
└── Props change behavior

❌ DON'T TEST:
├── Internal implementation details
├── Snapshot everything (only key components)
├── Styling specifics (brittle)
└── Third-party component internals
```

### Integration Tests

```
✅ TEST:
├── Form submission flows
├── Navigation between screens
├── State persistence across screens
├── API integration (with mocked server)
└── Context/provider interactions

❌ DON'T TEST:
├── Every possible path (use unit tests)
├── Third-party services (mock them)
└── Backend logic (backend tests)
```

### E2E Tests

```
✅ TEST:
├── Critical user journeys (login, purchase, signup)
├── Offline → online transitions
├── Deep link handling
├── Push notification navigation
├── Permission flows
└── Payment flows

❌ DON'T TEST:
├── Every edge case (too slow)
├── Visual regression (use snapshot tests)
├── Non-critical features
└── Backend-only logic
```

---

## 4. Platform-Specific Testing

### What Differs Between iOS and Android?

| Area                | iOS Behavior         | Android Behavior         | Test Both?      |
|---------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| **Back navigation** | Edge swipe           | System back button       | ✅ YES           |
| **Permissions**     | Ask once, settings   | Ask each time, rationale | ✅ YES           |
| **Keyboard**        | Different appearance | Different behavior       | ✅ YES           |
| **Date picker**     | Wheel/modal          | Material dialog          | ⚠️ If custom UI |
| **Push format**     | APNs payload         | FCM payload              | ✅ YES           |
| **Deep links**      | Universal Links      | App Links                | ✅ YES           |
| **Gestures**        | Some unique          | Material gestures        | ⚠️ If custom    |

### Platform Testing Strategy

```
FOR EACH PLATFORM:
├── Run unit tests (same on both)
├── Run component tests (same on both)
├── Run E2E on REAL DEVICE
│   ├── iOS: iPhone (not just simulator)
│   └── Android: Mid-range device (not flagship)
└── Test platform-specific features separately
```

---

## 5. Offline & Network Testing

### Offline Scenarios to Test

| Scenario              | What to Verify                       |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Start app offline     | Shows cached data or offline message |
| Go offline mid-action | Action queued, not lost              |
| Come back online      | Queue synced, no duplicates          |
| Slow network (2G)     | Loading states, timeouts work        |
| Flaky network         | Retry logic, error recovery          |

### How to Test Network Conditions

```
APPROACH:
├── Unit tests: Mock NetInfo, test logic
├── Integration: Mock API responses, test UI
├── E2E (Detox): Use device.setURLBlacklist()
├── E2E (Maestro): Use network conditions
└── Manual: Use Charles Proxy / Network Link Conditioner
```

## 6. Performance Testing

### What to Measure

| Metric                | Target           | How to Measure                 |
|-----------------------|------------------|--------------------------------|
| **App startup**       | < 2 seconds      | Profiler, Flashlight           |
| **Screen transition** | < 300ms          | React DevTools                 |
| **List scroll**       | 60 FPS           | Profiler, feel                 |
| **Memory**            | Stable, no leaks | Instruments / Android Profiler |
| **Bundle size**       | Minimize         | Metro bundler analysis         |

### When to Performance Test

```
PERFORMANCE TEST:
├── Before release (required)
├── After adding heavy features
├── After upgrading dependencies
├── When users report slowness
└── On CI (optional, automated benchmarks)

WHERE TO TEST:
├── Real device (REQUIRED)
├── Low-end device (Galaxy A series, old iPhone)
├── NOT on emulator (lies about performance)
└── With production-like data (not 3 items)
```

---

## 7. Accessibility Testing

### What to Verify

| Element              | Check                            |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| Interactive elements | Have accessibilityLabel          |
| Images               | Have alt text or decorative flag |
| Forms                | Labels linked to inputs          |
| Buttons              | Role = button                    |
| Touch targets        | ≥ 44x44 (iOS) / 48x48 (Android)  |
| Color contrast       | WCAG AA minimum                  |

### How to Test

```
AUTOMATED:
├── React Native: jest-axe
├── Flutter: Accessibility checker in tests
└── Lint rules for missing labels

MANUAL:
├── Enable VoiceOver (iOS) / TalkBack (Android)
├── Navigate entire app with screen reader
├── Test with increased text size
└── Test with reduced motion
```

---

## 8. CI/CD Integration

### What to Run Where

| Stage             | Tests            | Devices             |
|-------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **PR**            | Unit + Component | None (fast)         |
| **Merge to main** | + Integration    | Simulator/Emulator  |
| **Pre-release**   | + E2E            | Real devices (farm) |
| **Nightly**       | Full suite       | Device farm         |

### Device Farm Options

| Service               | Pros                      | Cons            |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| **Firebase Test Lab** | Free tier, Google devices | Android focus   |
| **AWS Device Farm**   | Wide selection            | Expensive       |
| **BrowserStack**      | Good UX                   | Expensive       |
| **Local devices**     | Free, reliable            | Limited variety |

## 🎯 Testing Questions to Ask

Before writing tests, answer:

1. **What could break?** → Test that
2. **What's critical for users?** → E2E test that
3. **What's complex logic?** → Unit test that
4. **What's platform-specific?** → Test on both platforms
5. **What happens offline?** → Test that scenario

> **Remember:** Good mobile testing is about testing the RIGHT things, not EVERYTHING. A flaky E2E test is worse than no
> test. A failing unit test that catches a bug is worth 100 passing trivial tests.
